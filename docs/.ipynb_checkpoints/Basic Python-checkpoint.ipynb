Python 2.0 was released.  The 2.0 release has gone through a number of major versions, ending in version 2.7. In 2008, Python 3.0 was released.  As of this writing, the latest stable version, 3.6, was released in December 2016.  \n",

    "<h2> The Python Virtual Machine </h2><br>\n",
    "Python uses the concept of a *virtual machine*.  This is similar to languages like Java.  Initially, programming languages were compiled.  That is, you would create a source code file in a language like C or Fortran, and then a special program called a *compiler* would take that source code and convert it into a file of binary code called an *object* file.  This is still done today for language like C, C++ and many others.  Java was the first language to widely use a new concept called a Virtual Machine. Java would take a source code file and compile it, not to object code but to an intermediate form called a *bytecode* file.  This bytecode file would then be compiled by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) to object code and then executed by the operating system.  \n",
    "\n",
    "While this sounds like unnecessary complexity, in fact, there are many advantages to this type of system.  Before the concept of a virtual machine, programmers needed to keep track of all computer memory allocated and de-allocated in their program.  Often, mistakes in the program would lead to crashes and indeterministic behavior on part of the program due to a flaw in the program's allocation of memory.  With a virtual machine, the VM itself takes care of the allocation and de-allocation of memory so the programmer no longer needs to worry about it.  This leads to far more robust programs since an entire class of potential error has been removed.  Following is a graphic illustration of how the Python Virtual Machine works. \n",

    "<h3>Identifiers</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "We start with Python by understanding the concept of *identifiers*.  An identifier is a name that is used to identify things in Python.  A thing in Python can be a variable, a function, a class, a module or any other valid Python object.  An identifier can contain upper or lower case letters (A to Z or a to z), numbers (0 to 9) or underscores \\(\\_\\). It is also important to understand that identifiers are *case sensitive*.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of valid identifiers in Python include:\n",
    "\n",
    "var1,<br>\n",
    "\\_\\_doc\\_\\_,<br>\n",
    "Myidentifier,<br>\n",

    "- Starting an identifier with an underscore indicates that the identifier is private.  For example \\_privvar\n",
    "- Starting an identifier with two underscores indicates that it is strongly private. For example \\_\\_privvar1\n",
    "- If an identifier starts with and ends with two double underscores, then it is a specially defined variable in the Python language.  For example \\_\\_init\\_\\_\n",
